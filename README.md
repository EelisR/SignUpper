# SignUpper
This is a demo/POC project of an event sign up service, with pretty barebones implementation and styling.

It has been done with SvelteKit and PocketBase, both are new technologies (for me)

The idea is to create a more advanced backend service that allows keeping track of the people in the waitlist to the event and 
send them a signup link when someone cancels their signup. 

Just an experimenting side project :)
